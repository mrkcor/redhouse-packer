# Introduction

This repository contains the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) template used for building the [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) base box that is used by Redhouse (a Vagrant box setup for developing Ruby applications). 

The scripts and setup borrow are based on those from the [Chef Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) and [Laravel Settler](https://github.com/laravel/settler) projects, thank you to all who have contributed to those projects to make the lives of many developers so much easier!
